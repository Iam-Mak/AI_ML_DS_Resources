### What is the CIA triad? 

The CIA triad is a widely used information security model that can guide an organization's efforts and policies aimed at keeping its data secure.The three principles on which infosec rests:.
- **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users and processes should be able to access or modify data.
- **Integrity:** Data should be maintained in a correct state and nobody should be able to improperly modify it, either accidentally or maliciously.
- **Availability:** Authorized users should be able to access data whenever they need to do so.

### Why is the CIA triad important?
It as a way to make sense of the bewildering array of security software, services, and techniques that are in the marketplace.

### CIA triad examples
Take the example of a bank ATM, which can offer users access to bank balances and other information. An ATM has tools that cover all three principles of the triad:

- It provides **confidentiality** by requiring two-factor authentication (both a physical card and a PIN code) before allowing access to data.
- The ATM and bank software enforce data **integrity** by ensuring that any transfers or withdrawals made via the machine are reflected in the accounting for the user's bank account.
- The machine provides **availability** because it's in a public place and is accessible even when the bank branch is closed.

The triad is a way of thinking, planning, and, perhaps most importantly, setting priorities.

### Special challenges for the CIA triad
Big data poses challenges to the CIA paradigm because of 
- The sheer volume of information that organizations need safeguarded.
- The multiplicity of sources that data comes from and the variety of formats in which it exists.
- Duplicate data sets and disaster recovery plans can multiply the already-high costs.

## Networking with LinkedIn and Twitter

### Twitter vs. LinkedIn: A Comparison
- Twitter offers a more laid-back environment than LinkedIn, and it provides easy access to a wide variety of people in a far faster way.
- LinkedIn can be the better of the two in terms of searching out potential contacts, yet Twitter allows you to connect and engage in conversation with someone you haven't connected with prior.
