### What is the CIA triad? 

The CIA triad is a widely used information security model that can guide an organization's efforts and policies aimed at keeping its data secure.The three principles on which infosec rests:.
- **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users and processes should be able to access or modify data.
- **Integrity:** Data should be maintained in a correct state and nobody should be able to improperly modify it, either accidentally or maliciously.
- **Availability:** Authorized users should be able to access data whenever they need to do so.

### Why is the CIA triad important?
It as a way to make sense of the bewildering array of security software, services, and techniques that are in the marketplace.

### CIA triad examples
Take the example of a bank ATM, which can offer users access to bank balances and other information. An ATM has tools that cover all three principles of the triad:

- It provides **confidentiality** by requiring two-factor authentication (both a physical card and a PIN code) before allowing access to data.
- The ATM and bank software enforce data **integrity** by ensuring that any transfers or withdrawals made via the machine are reflected in the accounting for the user's bank account.
- The machine provides **availability** because it's in a public place and is accessible even when the bank branch is closed.

The triad is a way of thinking, planning, and, perhaps most importantly, setting priorities.

### Special challenges for the CIA triad
Big data poses challenges to the CIA paradigm because of 
- The sheer volume of information that organizations need safeguarded.
- The multiplicity of sources that data comes from and the variety of formats in which it exists.
- Duplicate data sets and disaster recovery plans can multiply the already-high costs.
