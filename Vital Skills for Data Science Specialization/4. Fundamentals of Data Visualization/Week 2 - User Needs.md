## Week 2 User Needs 
## Visualization Tasks

### What are tasks? 
**Task:** The reason why the vis tool is being used Highest-level tasks-why is the user using the visualization (purpose) Middle level-what the user is doing (navigation) Low level-what the user is looking for (data attributes)
Tasks let us separate what we want to do with data from its domain

### Task Elicitation

- How do we characterize the tasks a visualization tool needs to support?
- Typically interview with domain experts or survey of past analyses in the field (or both)

### Key Questions

- Why is a task pursued? (goal) 
- How is a task conducted? (means) 
- What does a task seek to learn about the data? (characteristics) 
- Where does the task operate? (target data) 
- When is the task performed? (workflow)
-  Who is executing the task? (roles)

### Purpose

Why is a task performed? What are the user's goals?

- **Explore:** Consume existing information in order to produce new information

- Closely related to **confirm**-validate prior knowledge

- **Present:** Succinct communication of information

- Closely related to **enjoy**-casual encounters with a visualization

### Means

How are tasks conducted? How are users interacting with the data?
- **Navigation:** Move through the data
- **Organizing:** Change how the data is presented
- **Relation:** Build connections in the data

### Data Characteristics

What does a task seek to learn about the data? 
- Think traditional patterns and statistics
- Low-level characteristics consider individual points (e.g., estimate or compare specific values)
-High-level characteristics consider patterns across multiple points (e.g., trends or averages)

### Target Data

Where does the task operate? (target data)
- **Absolute reference frame:** The data is compared against some common, established standard (e.g., time, space)
- **Relative reference frame:** The data is compared against other data (e.g., comparing two sequences or texts)
