# Data Analytics with Python

**Variables** – is a characteristic of any entity being studied that is capable of taking on different values. <br>
**Measurements** – is when a standard process is used to assign numbers to particular attributes or characteristic of a variable.<br>
**Data** – data are recorded measurements.<br>

### Why Data is important?
- Data helps in make better decisions.
- Data helps in solve problems by finding the reason for underperformance.
- Data helps one to evaluate the performance.
- Data helps one improve processes.
- Data helps one understand consumers and the market.

## Define data analytics

- **Analytics** is defined as “the scientific process of transforming data into insights for making better decisions”.
- **Analytics**, is the use of data, **information technology, statistical analysis, quantitative methods**, and **mathematical** or **computer-based** models to help managers gain improved insight about their business operations and make better, fact-based decisions – *James Evans*.

## Data analysis

- **Data analysis** is the process of **examining, transforming**, and **arranging** raw data in a specific way to generate useful information from it.
- **Data analysis** allows for the evaluation of data through **analytical** and **logical reasoning** to lead to some sort of outcome or conclusion in some context.
- **Data analysis** is a multi-faceted process that involves a number of steps, approaches, and diverse techniques.

## Classification of Data analytics
Based on the phase of workflow and the kind of analysis required, there are four major types of data analytics.
- Descriptive analytics
- Diagnostic analytics
- Predictive analytics
- Prescriptive analytics

### Descriptive Analytics
- Descriptive Analytics, is the conventional form of Business Intelligence and data analysis.
- It seeks to provide a depiction or “summary view” of facts and figures in an understandable format.
- This either inform or prepare data for further analysis.
- Descriptive analysis or statistics can summarize raw data and convert it into a form that can be easily understood by humans.
- They can describe in detail about an event that has occurred in the past.
- Example - Data Queries, Reports, Descriptive Statistics, Data Visualization,Data dashboard.

### Diagnostic analytics

- Diagnostic Analytics is a form of advanced analytics which examines data or content to answer the question “Why did it happen?”.
- Diagnostic analytical tools aid an analyst to dig deeper into an issue so that they can arrive at the source of a problem.
- In a structured business environment, tools for both descriptive and diagnostic analytics go parallel.
- Example - Data Discovery , Data Mining, Correlations.

### Predictive analytics

- Predictive analytics helps to forecast trends based on the current events.
- Predicting the probability of an event happening in future or estimating the accurate time it will happen can all be determined with the help of predictive analytical models.
- Many different but co-dependent variables are analysed to predict a trend in this type of analysis.
- Example - Linear regression, Time series analysis and forecasting.

### Prescriptive analytics

- Set of techniques to indicate the best course of action
- It tells what decision to make to optimize the outcome
- The goal of prescriptive analytics is to enable: 1. Quality improvements, 2. Service enhancements, 3. Cost reductions and 4. Increasing productivity.
- Example - Optimization Model, Simulation, Decision Analysis.

### Levels of Data Measurement 
- **Nominal** — *Lowest level of measurement*- A nominal scale classifies data into distinct categories in which no ranking is implied. Example : Gender, Marital Status.
- **Ordinal** - An ordinal scale classifies data into distinct categories in which ranking is implied.Example : Student Grades -A, B, C, D, F.
- **Interval** - An interval scale is an ordered scale in which the difference between measurements is a meaningful quantity but the measurements do not have a true zero point. Example - Temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- **Ratio** — *Highest level of measurement* - A ratio scale is an ordered scale in which the difference between the measurements is a meaningful quantity and the measurements have a true zero point. Example :  Weight, Age, Salary.
