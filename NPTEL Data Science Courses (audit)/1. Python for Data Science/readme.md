## What is Data Science ?
- **Data Science** is the Science of analyzing **row data** using statistics and machine learning techniques with the purpose of drawing insights from data.
- **Data Science** is used in many industries to allow them to make better business decisions, and in the science to test models or theories.
- This requires a process of **inspecting, cleaning, transforming, modelling, analyzing** and **interpreting** raw data.

### Data Perspective 
- Read Data
- Data processing and cleaning
- Summarizing data
- Visualization
- Deriving insights from data

# Week 1
#### Q : What is the difference between data science and big data analytics?
- **Data science** is a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithm development,
and technology in order to solve analytically complex problems. 
- **Big data analytics** is the use of advanced analytic techniques against very large, diverse data sets that include structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, from different sources, and in different sizes from terabytes to zettabytes.

#### Q : What is an IDE and why should we use IDE?
**Ans.** An IDE stands for **Integrated Development Environment**. It is a software application
consisting of a cohesive unit of tools required for development. It is designed to simplify
software development. Utilities provided by IDEs include tools for managing, compiling,
deploying and debugging software.

#### Q : What is version control?
**Ans.** **Version control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so
that you can recall specific versions later.

#### Q : What is the difference between pascal and camel case?
**Ans.** Pascal- capitalizes each word ex: **PascalCase**
- Camel Lower Casing - is similar to pascal case but the first word is not capitalized.
- Camel Upper Casing - is similar to pascal case but the first word is capitalized.

#### Q : How does one change the name of the key once assigned?.
**Ans.** Keys cannot be changed. You need to add a new key with the modified value then remove the old one, or create a new dictionary with a new dictionary key.

#### Q : What if more than 2 words are repeated and we want to remove the word more than 2 so how can we use the remove()?
**Ans.** Kindly write a loop and execute the statements.

#### Q : Explain immutability?
**Ans.** Once an object is created you will not be able to modify the elements, that refers to immutability.

#### Q :How do we know whether it is positive indexing or negative indexing ? Is there any command to know about indexing?
**Ans.** The positive index starts from 0 to n-1 (with positive sign) Negative indexing is used to access elements from the end of a list negative indexing starts from -1 to -(n) (with negative sign)

# Week 3

#### Q : How do you get the number of unique data types in a given dataframe?
**Ans.** Pandas dataframe.get_dtype_counts() function returns the counts of dtypes in the given dataframe. It returns a pandas series object containing the counts of all data types present in the pandas object.

#### Q : How to find out if there are any duplicate values in a DataFrame ?
**Ans.** To find out duplicated values, use the pandas.DataFrame.duplicated() function.

#### Q : What is difference between pandas.DataFrame.drop() and pandas.DataFrame.dropna() functions?
**Ans.** The function pandas.DataFrame.drop() removes rows or columns by specifying label names and corresponding axis, or by specifying directly index or column names The function pandas.DataFrame.dropna() drops rows with missing values.

#### Q : Can a dataframe be multi-dimensional?
**Ans.** No. A data frame consists of only 2 dimensions i.e. rows and columns. Each column stores data corresponding to a specific dimension.
