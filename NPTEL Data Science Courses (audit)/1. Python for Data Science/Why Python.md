## Python as a programming language
- Supports multiple programming paradigm
◦ Functional, Structural, OOPs, etc.
- Dynamic typing
◦ Runtime type safety checks.
- Reference counts
◦ Deallocates objects which are not used for long.
- Late binding
◦ Methods are looked up by name during runtime.
- Python’s design is guided by 20 aphorisms as described in Zen of Python by Tim Peters.
- Standard CPython interpreter is managed by “Python Software
Foundation”.
- There are other interpreters namely **JPython (Java), Iron Python
(C#), Stackless Python (C, used for parallelism), PyPy (Python
itself JIT compilation)**.
- Standard libraries are written in python itself.
- High standards of readability.
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac).
- Highly supported by a large community group.
- Better error handle.

### Comparison to Java
####  Python vs Java
- Java is statically typed i.e. type safety is checked during compilation
(static compilation).
- Thus in Java the time required to develop the code is more.
- Python which is dynamically typed compensates for huge
compilation time when compared to Java.
- Codes which are dynamically typed tend to be less verbose
therefore offering more readability.

### Advantages of using python

- Python has several features that make it well suited for data
science.
-  Open source and community development
◦ Developed under Open Source Initiative license making it free to use
and distribute even commercially.
- Syntax used is simple to understand and code.
- Libraries designed for specific data science tasks.
- Combines well with majority of the cloud platform service
providers.

### Coding environment

- A software program can be written using a terminal, a
command prompt (cmd), a text editor or through an **Integrated
Development Environment (IDE)**.
- The program needs to be saved in a file with an appropriate
extension (.py for python, .mat for matlab, etc...) and can be
executed in corresponding environment (Python, Matlab, etc...).
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a software
product solely developed to support software development in
various or specific programming language(s).

### Integrated development environment (IDE)

- Software application consisting of a cohesive unit of tools
required for development.
- Designed to simplify software development.
- Utilities provided by IDEs include tools for **managing, compiling,
deploying** and **debugging** software.

### Coding environment- IDE

- An IDE usually comprises of
◦ Source code editor
◦ Compiler
◦ Debugger
◦ Additional features include syntax and error highlighting,
code completion.
- Offers supports in building and executing the program along
with debugging the code from within the environment.

### Coding environment- IDE

- Best IDEs provide version control features.
- Eclipse+PyDev, SublimeText, Atom, GNU Emacs, Vi/Vim, Visual.
Studio, Visual Studio Code are general IDEs with python
support.
- Apart from these some of the python specific editors include
Pycharm, Jupyter, Spyder, Thonny.
